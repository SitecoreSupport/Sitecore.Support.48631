There is an issue related to the general link field. After the field changing and clicking the button (Insert Link, Insert Media Link, Insert External Link, Insert Anchor, Insert Email or Insert JavaScript) to edit a link, the dialog is opened without the prepopulated fields values.
This patch fixes the described behavior.
